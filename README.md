# Yumpanadas

A single page application created with React, Rails and Material UI. Yumpanadas was inspired by my love for empanadas and the desire to be able to discover empanadas food trucks or venues nearby, anywhere in NYC. The goal of this app was to connect users with nearby empanada venues and food trucks with an additional option to save an empanada spot.

## Features

* Users can sign up, login or log out from landing page and have a user profile.

* Users can click a button that will detect user location and display nearby empanada venues and food trucks.

* Users can save businesses they choose to save in their profile for a future return.

* User can delete a saved empanada business from their profile
